      p('FIRE stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. It is a personal finance movement built around one core idea: save and invest aggressively enough that your portfolio generates enough passive income to cover your living expenses — indefinitely. At that point, paid work becomes optional.'),
      p('The FIRE movement grew out of the early retirement community in the 1990s, popularised in large part by the book Your Money or Your Life by Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez. It accelerated dramatically through the 2010s as bloggers like Mr. Money Mustache demonstrated that retiring in your 30s or 40s was achievable on ordinary incomes.'),
      h2('How does FIRE actually work?'),
      p('FIRE has a simple mechanical core. You track your annual spending, multiply it by 25, and that is your target portfolio size. The multiplier comes from the 4% safe withdrawal rule: a diversified portfolio can support annual withdrawals of 4% of its starting value — inflation-adjusted — over a 30-year retirement without running out.'),
      p('For example, if you spend $50,000 per year, your FIRE number is $1,250,000. When your investment portfolio reaches that number, you are theoretically financially independent. The mechanics involve low-cost index funds, tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s and Roth IRAs, and maximising the gap between income and spending.'),
      h2('Why savings rate is the most powerful lever'),
      p('The critical variable in FIRE is your savings rate — the percentage of take-home income you invest each month. Because a higher rate simultaneously grows your portfolio faster and proves you can live on less, it has a compounding effect on your timeline.'),

      p('These timelines hold across a wide range of income levels because the ratio is what matters, not the raw amount. A household earning $80,000 and saving $40,000 builds wealth faster than one earning $200,000 and saving $20,000.'),

      ]),
      h2('Is FIRE realistic?'),
      p('FIRE is achievable for a much wider range of households than the critics assume, but it requires honest accounting. The key inputs are income stability, controllable expenses, a long enough timeline, and a willingness to invest in low-cost diversified funds rather than saving cash. It is not a guaranteed outcome — market returns matter, and sequence-of-returns risk is real. But the framework is sound, and millions of people have used it to reach meaningful financial independence before traditional retirement age.'),

A household spending $60,000 per year with $18,000 in expected Social Security income only needs a portfolio to cover $42,000 annually, reducing the target from $1,500,000 to around $1,050,000.'),

A realistic plan accounts for an effective tax rate on withdrawals of 10–20%, depending on your income bracket and state. This means your gross withdrawal target should be higher than your net spending target.'),
      p('Inflation — historically around 2–3% annually — erodes purchasing power over a 30-50 year retirement. Most sound FIRE projections assume nominal returns of 7% and subtract 3% for inflation to arrive at a real return of around 4%, which aligns with the 4% withdrawal rule.'),

They examined historical US stock and bond returns from 1926 to 1995 and tested how various withdrawal rates would have held up across all 30-year periods in that dataset. A 4% annual withdrawal rate, adjusted for inflation each year, survived 95%+ of those 30-year windows.'),

      h2('When the 4% rule understates risk'),
      p('The original study used historical US data — the best-performing equity market in history. International data suggests withdrawal rates around 3–3.5% are safer for global portfolios. Starting retirement in a period of high valuations (measured by the Shiller CAPE ratio) historically correlates with lower subsequent returns, making higher withdrawal rates riskier.'),
      p('Sequence-of-returns risk is a major factor the rule does not address directly. A major market decline in the first few years of retirement — before the portfolio has had time to recover — can permanently impair a portfolio even if long-term average returns are fine.'),
